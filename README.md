# Mac Security Assistant

Helps you to better secure your Mac, with options to update OS X to the latest version, enable your Firewall, update X-Protect's signatures, enable FileVault, and set a Firmware password.

Most of these things cannot be done by the app itself, but instead the app directs the user to the specific setting they would need to toggle.

Any and all help in not only allowing the app to perform all aforementioned options by itself, but also in making the app more fluid would be appreciated.

Note that Mac Security Assistant is for Mac only, and runs using AppleScript.
